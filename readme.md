# Gatsby Plugin Transition Link

TransitionLink provides a simple api for describing expressive transitions between pages in [Gatsbyjs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). Page links are used to determine which transition should fire, making page transitions flexible and easy to use.

TransitionLink is compatible with declarative react animation libraries like [react-pose](https://popmotion.io/pose/) and [react-spring](https://react-spring.surge.sh/). It's also compatible with imperative animation libraries like [gsap](https://greensock.com) and [anime.js](http://animejs.com/)
